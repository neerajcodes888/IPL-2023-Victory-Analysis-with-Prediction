## Introduction
This project aims to analyze IPL match data from 2008-2022 and make predictions based on the analysis. It includes an analysis notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`) for exploring the data and a prediction notebook (`Prediction.ipynb`) for developing a prediction model. The web application for predictions is built using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze IPL match data from 2008-2022 and make predictions based on the analysis. It includes an analysis notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`) for exploring the data and a prediction notebook (`Prediction.ipynb`) for developing a prediction model. The web application for predictions is built using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- Analyze IPL match data from 2008 to 2022.
- Develop and train prediction models based on historical data.
- Deploy a Flask-based web application for interactive predictions.
- Gain insights into team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes.
- Make predictions on upcoming IPL matches.

## Demo
